DESCRIPTION
    With Catmandu, LibreCat tools abstract digital library and research
    services as data warehouse processes. As stores we reuse MongoDB or
    ElasticSearch providing us with developer friendly APIs. Catmandu works
    with international library standards such as MARC, MODS and Dublin Core,
    protocols such as OAI-PMH, SRU and open repositories such as DSpace and
    Fedora. And, of course, we speak the evolving Semantic Web.

    Follow us on <http://librecat.org> and read an introduction into
    Catmandu data processing at <https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu/wiki>.
